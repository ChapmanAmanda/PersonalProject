# PersonalProject
My personal project is an android app that keeps inventory 

Problem Statement:  
The goal of this project is to create a maintainable Android application that runs smoothly and can be built upon in time.   
The boundaries of this project include the language, the options include Java and Kotlin.  
The IDEs are limited as well, with a choice between Android Studio or Eclipse. Constraints for this project include limited knowledge of programming language, familiarity with Android Studio, JDK being used, a six week time limit, and availability to access Android Studio (can't be installed on school computers).  
 To be successful in this goal the project needs to work, be user friendly, and get a grade of B or higher.  
 Some assumptions about making this project are that an Android phone will be available to test the app, that Android Studio is accessible everywhere, and that somebody with Andoid Studio knowledge will always be around to help.   
 Stakeholders in this project include myself, Professor Vanselow, and potential employers. 
 The timeline I have created and hope to stick to, by week: 

Install IDE, watch Android Studio tutorial videos, come up with and finalize project idea  
Learn the Android basics, continue tutorial videos including user input, whiteboard project, psuedocode  
Tutorial videos including multi-screen apps, work on psuedocode, start to code, get help  
Tutorial videos including networking, code, watch videos on importing data  
Tutorial videos including data storage, code, seek help to look over/improve code, run tests  
Finish code, test app, run tests using other people, seek help in improving code, turn in  

Time log:  
Spent 3.5 hours watching android studio tutorial videos 
In the course: building layouts part 1 
Final poject idea: a kitchen inventory app that can be used both at home and at work in restaurants  
Spent 1.5 hours whiteboarding project idea 
Became familiar with android studio 
Psuedocode rough draft 

Up next week: 
Watch next tutorial videos, next lesson in Android Basics 
Code in android studio 
Get advice/help from classmates with experience in Android app development
